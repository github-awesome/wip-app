# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Github Awesome's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you in our app, https://github.com/marketplace/wip-work-in-progress, and other places we own and operate.

## Information collection

When installing the app you grant it access to the following scopes:

1. **Read & write access to [pull requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/#permission-on-statuses)**

   The app looks for terms in the pull request title, body, labels and commit messages. It requires write access to amend a "pending" status for a pull request.

2. **Read & write access to [checks](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/#permission-on-checks)**

   The app uses checks to explain why the status for your pull request has been set to pending or success.


The app receives [CheckRun](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#checkrunevent) and [PullRequest](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent) events from GitHub, but any data not required for the functionality of the app is discarded.

We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.

Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

Your continued use of our app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

This policy is effective as of 24 April 2019.
